# ⚙️ C++ Programs

The C++ programming language is a grind. Nothing great to say about it. Anyway, this repository and accompanying website provide concise code examples that demonstrate various aspects of C++ programming.

## Examples

Example code is located in the `cpp-projects` and `cpp-scripts` directories. Some of the examples are discussed on the Notes page at [gavinw.me/notes](https://gavinw.me/notes).
