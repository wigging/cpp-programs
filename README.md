# C++ Programs

The purpose of this repository and accompanying website is to provide simple C++ programming examples with brief descriptions of the code. Code files for the examples are located in the `cpp-projects` and `cpp-scripts` folders while website files are in the `docs` folder. The website is available at https://gavinw.me/cpp-programs. It is generated with the [genja](https://github.com/wigging/genja) tool where Markdown files are in the `content` folder and the generated HTML files are in the `docs` folder.
