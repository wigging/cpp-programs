# ⚙️ C++ Programs

The C++ programming language is a grind. Nothing great to say about it. Anyway, this repository and accompanying website provide concise code examples that demonstrate various aspects of C++ programming. The website is available at https://wigging.me/cpp-programs.

## Examples

Example code is located in the `cpp-projects` and `cpp-scripts` folders.

## Website

The website is available at https://wigging.me/cpp-programs. It is generated with the [genja](https://github.com/wigging/genja) tool using the `content`, `docs`, `templates` folders and the `config.json` file. The website is hosted with GitHub Pages from the `docs` folder.
