Examples of integer, float, and double numbers are given below. An integer is just a whole number (no decimals). A float is a number with up to 7 decimal digits and a double is up to 15 decimal digits of precision.

```cpp
// numbers.cpp

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int a = 9;
    float b = 3.14;
    double c = 3.14159;

    std::cout << "a is " << a << std::endl;
    std::cout << "b is " << b << std::endl;
    std::cout << "c is " << c << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

The above code example will print the output shown below.

```
a is 9
b is 3.14
c is 3.14159
```
