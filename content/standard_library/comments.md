C++ supports single-line and multiline comments. A single-line comment is represented by two forward slashes `//`.

```cpp
// a single line comment

int x = 99;  // comment after a variable
```

A multiline comment is represented by a forward slash and asterisk `/* */`.

```cpp
/*
This is a
multiline comment.
*/

int x = 99;
```
